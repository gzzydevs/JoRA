  "title": "Refactor TaskManager - Split into smaller modules",
  "description": "The task-manager.js file has grown too large (670+ lines) and is becoming difficult to work with, especially for AI agents. Need to split it into smaller, focused modules:\n\n1. **TaskManager** (main class) - coordination and public API\n2. **FileManager** - file I/O operations (load/save tasks, epics, etc.)\n3. **ValidationManager** - data validation and schema checking\n4. **ReleaseManager** - release generation and management\n5. **MigrationManager** - data migration and backwards compatibility\n\nBenefits:\n- Easier to understand and maintain\n- Better separation of concerns\n- More testable code\n- Easier for AI agents to work with smaller files\n- Reduced cognitive load when making changes",
